# [OMSP-OPCLOSE-03] Bluetooth
## Description
Given the irruption of the Bluetooth standard for the data transmission between devices, it is not surprising that vehicle opening systems are moving from relatively basic proprietary protocols, based on low frequency transmissions, to the development of Bluetooth-based authentication systems, using both smartphone applications or propierary transmitters. 

## How to Test
In this case, the attacks will be focused on breaking the established protocol, either at the radio frequency level (emitting signals that open the car) or at the application level, if it is the case.
